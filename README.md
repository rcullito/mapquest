# mapquest

a tiny clojure library of functions and macros for dealing with maps

## Rationale

merge-left - useful when the desired behavior is for keys to be preserved in a left to right manner


keyword-in-set - as it is common to pass around a map of data, and check a value in this map against set membership, this helper macro takes the name of a one-off predicate, the key of the map that we will care about, and the set to test that key's value against



```
(keyword-in-set valid-suite? :suite #{"hearts" "spades" "clubs" "diamonds"})

(valid-suite? {:suite "spades"}) => "spades"
(valid-suite? {:suite "circles"}) => nil 
```
